CHECK THIS BEFORE START CODING THAT PIECE OF SHIT YOU WERE THINKING:
	. Have you missed something in the statements?
	. Did you understood ALL the sample cases?
	. Can you think another easier way to solve this?
	. What is the memory complexity?
	. What is the time complexity?
	. Is it too greedy?
	. Create those fucking corner cases (if applicable):
		. -1
		.  0
		. +1
		. negative number
		. big number
		. lower limit
		. upper limit
	. Take some time to review how you should implement your idea
